## What is CarbonSpigot?
It is an advanced PaperSpigot fork specifically designed to elevate the PvP experience by implementing significant modifications to the core NMS code. Our enhanced version incorporates a range of additional enhancements and improvements to ensure optimal gameplay. Thorough testing, involving over 700+ players, has confirmed its stability, maintaining a consistent 20 ticks per second (TPS) for an uninterrupted experience. One of the key highlights of our fork is the remarkable smoothness and fluidity it offers in terms of knockback mechanics, potions, and hit detection. These crucial aspects of PvP have been finely tuned to provide players with an exceptional combat experience. Moreover, our implementation of API additions and alterations offers developers unparalleled flexibility and an enhanced environment for crafting plugins tailored to their Carbon server.
